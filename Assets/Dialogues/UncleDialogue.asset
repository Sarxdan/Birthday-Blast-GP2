    - Ahoy, you little pirate! You managed to find your old uncle all the way out
      here. You should be proud....oh wait.....was it Aunt Bessy who sent you!?
    - You should not listen to that hag, you should always listen to your old uncle.
      He is always right.....even when he is wrong! haha
    - Oh, I almost forgot, I wanted to give you this present last year but your mom
      wouldn't let me. She said it is too dangerous....but she isn't here now! haha,
      here take it!
    - 'You should target practice on does pesky bees! I hate them, they are all over
      the place! See you around kiddo '
