    - Heey!.....you made it! I heard you got your dad's old jetpack as a birthday
      gift.....I wasn't sure you would make it over here alive.....hehe
    - But here you are. So I guess a little birthday gift is in order then! I was
      too lazy to wrap it but I hope you like it anyway
    - 'Oh, and if you are looking for mom she probably went to see your uncle on
      the other island. Just follow the big tree and cross the bridges. '
    - 'And remember.....don''t drink the jet fuel, you know how your uncle behaves
      when he does! '
